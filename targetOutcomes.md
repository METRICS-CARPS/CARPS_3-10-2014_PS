# Target Outcomes
## Article ID: 3-10-2014 PS

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in "The exploration task" part of the results section.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> The top row of Figure 2 presents exploration rates (the
percentage of trials in which participants tried new keys)
across 4 blocks of 25 trials each. To further examine
exploration rates, we conducted a 4 (block: 1, 2, 3, 4) × 3 (reward frequency: extremely low, moderate, extremely high) × 2 (control group: with-control, yoked) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), which revealed a significant three-way interaction, F(6, 342) = 3.35, p < .01, ηp 2 = .05. A post hoc Tukey’s test of exploration rates in the two control groups revealed that when the frequency of rewards from exploration was extremely low (p = .1), exploration rates decreased from about 70%
in the first block to approximately 40% in the last block
for both the with-control (p < .01) and the yoked (p < .01)
groups. However, when reward frequency was moderate
(p = .2), with-control participants continued to explore in
about 70% of the trials, whereas yoked participants
reduced their exploration rates to approximately 40%.
This difference between the groups was evident in the
second block (p < .01) and remained after yoked participants
regained control (p < .01 and p = .09 for the third
and fourth blocks, respectively). Finally, when reward
frequency was extremely high (p = 1), yoked participants
explored less than with-control participants in the second
block (p < .01); however, this gap disappeared immediately
after yoked participants regained control (ps > .9 for
the third and fourth blocks). In summary, the classic
learned-helplessness pattern was observed only when
the reward frequency was moderate.
